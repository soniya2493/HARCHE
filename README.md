# Harche - Huge data Analysis, Reporting and Caching for applications using the MapReduce Framework 

The main objective of HARCHE is to reduce the effort of the administrator in managing large amount of data.

This Big Data project has been developed using Python for the front end. THe backend is implemented using HDFS and Spark SQL. The main application essentially fetches the required data and stores the details using HDFS.

## SCOPE FOR FURTHER ENHANCEMENT
 
  - A module from where entities can communicate
  - Future prediction of data using past and present data
  - Report mailing system can be used
  - This system can be enhanced as a simple mobile application, which provides notification and report
  - More efficient cryptographic, compression algorithms can be used to improve the system efficiency
